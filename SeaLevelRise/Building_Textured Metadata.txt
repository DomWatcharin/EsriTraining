Description:
Buildings are the foundation of any 3D city; they create a realistic visual context for understanding the built environment. This rule can help you quickly create 3D buildings using your existing 2D building footprint polygons.  Create buildings for your whole city or specific areas of interest. Use the buildings for context surrounding higher-detail buildings or proposed future developments.
